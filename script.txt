-- Our field will be the rational numbers, since fractions are only implemented
--	for ZZ, QQ and finite fields
-- WARNING! For the methods: createTMatrix, molienTerm and molienTeo, this variable cannot
--			be overwritten, our else we cannot add the final polinomial fractions

R = QQ[t];

-- ## FUNCTIONS ## --
-- Function that constructs an n x n  identity matrix with the variable 't', corresponding to the ring 
--		R = QQ[t] declared before. (I'm sure there is an easier way to do this but I could not find it)
-- Returns: an n x n identity matrix with the variable 't' on the diagonal

        	else if i == j - 1 then w = t 
        	else w = 0);
      matrix(m)
);
