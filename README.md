# Invariant Theory
## Final Project

This repository corresponds to the final project of the course: *Algorithms on Invariant Theory*, offered at Universidad de los Andes by Mauricio Velasco Gregory on the first semester of 2017.

The subject of this project is to create a script that can run on Macaulay2 (*http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/*) that can do the following:

Given a list of matrices, we assume they are the image of some finite group **G** under the representation **rho** over a vector space **W** and the script should find a presentation of the invariant ring  of **C[W^]** under **rho**.

This project is developed with Daniel de Roux.
